### Technologies

- In this simple SPA, I utilized ReactJS

### Note

- To run this in Heroku, add [this buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack) to the Heroku settings

- To run this locally, follow these steps:

  1. Clone this project
  1. Run `npm install`
  1. Run `npm start`

_For the best UX, do *not* use a mobile device and *disable* dark mode extensions such as Dark Reader._
