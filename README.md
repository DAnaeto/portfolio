### Technologies

- In this simple SPA, I utilized React.

https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack

- To run this locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this project
2. Run ```npm install```
3. Run ```npm start```


Note: For the best UX, use a browser and disable dark mode extensions such as Dark Reader.
